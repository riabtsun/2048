# 2048. A single-player sliding tile puzzle video game

Short info from [wikipedia.org](https://https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2048_(video_game)).

2048 is played on a plain 4Ã—4 grid, with numbered tiles that slide when a player moves them using the four arrow 
keys. The game begins with two tiles already in the grid, having a value of either 2 or 4, and another such tile 
appears in a random empty space after each turn. Tiles with a value of 2 appear 90% of the time, and tiles with 
a value of 4 appear 10% of the time. Tiles slide as far as possible in the chosen direction until they are 
stopped by either another tile or the edge of the grid. If two tiles of the same number collide while moving, 
they will merge into a tile with the total value of the two tiles that collided. The resulting tile cannot
merge with another tile again in the same move. Higher-scoring tiles emit a soft glow; the largest possible 
tile is 131,072.

If a move causes three consecutive tiles of the same value to slide together, only the two tiles farthest along 
the direction of motion will combine. If all four spaces in a row or column are filled with tiles of the same value,
a move parallel to that row/column will combine the first two and last two. A scoreboard on the upper-right keeps 
track of the user's score. The user's score starts at zero, and is increased whenever two tiles combine, by the 
value of the new tile.

The game is won when a tile with a value of 2048 appears on the board. Players can continue beyond that to reach 
higher scores.When the player has no legal moves (there are no empty spaces and no adjacent tiles with the same
value), the game ends.
